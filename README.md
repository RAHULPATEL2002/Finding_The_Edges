## Finding the Edges

## AIM
For a color image, convert RGB to Grayscale and find the edges using the following operators:
1. Prewitt Operators.
2. Sobel Operators.
3. Use of a smoothing filter (averaging filter) with the Sobel operator.

---

## Features
This MATLAB script performs the following tasks:
- Converts a color image to grayscale.
- Detects edges using Prewitt and Sobel operators.
- Applies a smoothing filter before Sobel edge detection.
- Allows users to upload an image interactively for processing.

---

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local system.
2. Ensure MATLAB (R2020b or later) and the Image Processing Toolbox are installed.
3. Run the script `edge_detection.m` in MATLAB.
4. When prompted, select an image file to process (supported formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`).

---

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2020b or later.
- Image Processing Toolbox.

---

## Instructions
1. Save the file as `edge_detection.m`.
2. Run the script in MATLAB.
3. Follow the prompts to upload an image for edge detection.
